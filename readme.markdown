DTRichTextEditor Demo
=====================

This is a sample app demonstrating how to integrate and test the time-limited DTRichTextEditor framework.

1. Download the time-limited binary version from [here](http://beta.cocoanetics.com/demo/DTRichTextEditor.embeddedframework.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. Drag the DTRichTextEditor.embeddedframework folder into your project, copy it into the project and add it to your target
4. Build&Run

When running the component will output its expiration date on the console. DO NOT deploy any apps with this because those will crash after the expiration date.

You can purchase a source code license [in my parts store](http://www.cocoanetics.com/parts/dtrichtexteditor/) for 500 Euros. (Click the "Available on the Parts Store" button)

Read [this article](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/02/dtrichtexteditor-dtcoretext-news/) for an explanation how DTRichTextEditor, DTCoreText, DTLoupe and DTWebView work together.
