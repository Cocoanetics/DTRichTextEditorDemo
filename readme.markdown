DTRichTextEditor Demo
=====================

This is a sample app demonstrating how to integrate and test the time-limited DTRichTextEditor framework. 

Read [this article](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/02/dtrichtexteditor-dtcoretext-news/) for an explanation how DTRichTextEditor, DTCoreText, DTLoupe and DTWebView work together.

### Setup

Note: This framework is only for demonstrating the technology. If you purchase the component you will be integrating it either via CocoaPods or git sub-module and xcode sub-project.

1. Download the time-limited binary version from [here](http://beta.cocoanetics.com/demo/DTRichTextEditor.embeddedframework.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. Drag the DTRichTextEditor.embeddedframework folder into your project, copy it into the project and add it to your target
4. Build&Run

When running the component will output its expiration date on the console. DO NOT deploy any apps with this because those will crash after the expiration date.

### Purchasing

You can purchase a source code license [on the Cocoanetics Parts Store](http://www.cocoanetics.com/parts/dtrichtexteditor/) for 500 Euros. You will receive access to our private git repository where the component is continuously being worked on.
